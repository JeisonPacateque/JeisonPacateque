<h1 align='center'> Hola! Hi! Hallo! ðŸ‘‹</h1> 
<br>


I am Jeison, 

I am a Software Engineer with 7+ years of diverse experience in various tech domains and business objectives. I embrace **team working**, **continuous learning**, and **good development practices**. My current goal is to transform **machine learning** models into real-world solutions that create value and impact.


In my latest role, I was part of the **Machine Learning Delivery** team at [Mercado Libre](https://www.mercadolibre.com/), the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America. I orchestrate data wrangling with SQL queries on BigQuery, fueling the cutting-edge ML models that drive user engagement with Mercado Pago. I collaborate with a marketing-focused team, leveraging data-driven insights to design and deliver personalized push notifications and email campaigns, tracking and elevating KPIs like open rate, conversion rate, and lift. 


Previously, I worked on Backend Development mastering Python and frameworks like Django and Flask. I have also experience with JavaScript and Elixir (Phoenix). I contributed to the development of the 'EY Blockchain Analyzer: Reconciler' at [Globant](https://www.globant.com/), with Ernst & Young as a stakeholder, where I became proficient in agile methodologies and ventured into the Microsoft Azure ecosystem, using Docker and Kubernetes for service deployment.
